# Stock Market Prediction using Yahoo Finance Data
## Inspiration ðŸŒŸ
The stock market, characterized by volatility and uncertainty, presents a challenge for investors to make informed decisions. Our project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict stock prices accurately, thereby empowering investors with valuable insights for making strategic investment decisions.

## Problem Statement ðŸŽ¯
Investors often face difficulty in predicting stock prices due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. Our project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately forecasting stock prices, enabling investors to mitigate risks and optimize their investment strategies.

## What it Does ðŸš€
The Stock Market Prediction model utilizes historical stock price data obtained from Yahoo Finance to forecast future price movements. By analyzing key indicators such as historical prices, trading volume, and technical indicators, the model generates predictions that assist investors in making informed decisions regarding buying, selling, or holding stocks. Additionally, the model provides insights into market trends and patterns, facilitating a deeper understanding of market dynamics.

## How I Built It ðŸ› 
Data Collection:

Gathered historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance API, including features such as open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume.
Data Preprocessing:

Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
Feature Engineering:

Engineered relevant features such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and exponential moving averages (EMA) to capture market trends and patterns.
Model Selection and Training:

Implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Sequential model using Keras to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
Utilized scikit-learn for hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set.
Deployment:

Deployed the trained model using Flask or another web framework to provide a user-friendly interface for making real-time stock price predictions.
## What I Learnt ðŸ§ 
Developed proficiency in collecting and preprocessing financial data from APIs such as Yahoo Finance.
Acquired knowledge of feature engineering techniques for extracting relevant information from stock market data.
Mastered the implementation of LSTM Sequential models using Keras for time series forecasting.
Gained experience in model evaluation and performance metrics specific to financial forecasting tasks.
## Future Enhancements ðŸš€
Explore ensemble methods and hybrid models combining LSTM with traditional machine learning algorithms for improved prediction accuracy.
Incorporate additional data sources such as news sentiment analysis and macroeconomic indicators to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.
Implement advanced techniques for handling non-stationary data and capturing long-term dependencies in stock price movements.
